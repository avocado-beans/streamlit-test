We have recently started to use a more modern and technology-based approach when it comes to farming; and this project aims to play a part in that.  \n  \nPlantr is a project that combines a chatGPT-like LLM (AI21) and an image recognition API (Pl@ntNet) to first recognize and identify plants from pictures and then give the user information about how the plant can be taken care of, how it could be used, etc.")
st.write("The main feature of this site is that you can use the LLM to roughly predict what kind of effect introducing a novel plant population would have on the ecosystem it joins. There's a map to choose co-ordinates and everything.  \n  \nThis approach is far from perfect, but I believe it paves the way towards using these AI models and API's in new and innovative ways.")
